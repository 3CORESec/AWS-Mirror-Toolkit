## Tools

Currently available tools:

* [3CS AWS AutoMirror](https://github.com/3CORESec/AWS-AutoMirror) - Automatic session mirror creation
* [3CS AWS Config Mirror Session](https://github.com/3CORESec/AWS-Config-MirrorSession) - Traffic mirror session compliance
* New project soon!

Even though these are separate projects they have been developed to complement each other. You're free to use them together or separately. 

## How do I use them?

For detailed instructions on how to use each tool please visit the repository of the project you're interested in. 

## Development objectives

The general availability of traffic mirror sessions in AWS is a great step towards traffic analyses. We did find, however, that using those features at scale could be hard to maintain and prone to error. The tools available here are our attempt at addressing these concerns.
